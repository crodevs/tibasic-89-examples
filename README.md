# TI-BASIC
Some TI-BASIC 89 programs for my TI-89 Titanium (68k)
## Build
Install [TIEdit](http://pengels.bplaced.net/index.php/tiedit) to view and edit source.

TIEdit.exe > File > Open > source.89p

### TODO
I eventually want to implement the tibasic compiler for the TI-89, potentially by forking the [tibasic](https://github.com/miselin/tibasic) repo
## Deploy
Install [TIConnect](https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-sw) to upload programs to an actual TI-89 device
